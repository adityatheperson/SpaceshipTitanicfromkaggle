# SpaceshipTitanicfromkaggle
I tried solving the spaceship titanic completion problem from kaggle. (https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/spaceship-titanic)

I tried using multple models to get the best accuracy. Then I tried to use the package tpot to find what the best model is. 

I used label enconders and scalers to help clean the data data. I used even column execpt for "Name", and "PassengerId".
